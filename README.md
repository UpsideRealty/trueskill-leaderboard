Usage:

1. `npm install` to install dependencies.

1. `npm run rate "<scores>"` to generate rating. `<scores>` are tab delimited rows of player positions which can be easily retrieved from an excel sheet by simply highlighting the region and copy and pasting. 

    Example:
    ```
    npm run rate "Cookie      Michal  Matt    Kevin
    Matt    Cookie  Nick    Michal
    Matt    Kevin   Nick    Cookie"
    ```
